## Can I use this plugin in Minecraft 1.7.10 ?

This plugin is designed for Minecraft 1.8.8, using it in 1.7.10 will probably not work.
However, you can make a 1.8.8 server and use [ViaVersion](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/viaversion.19254/), [ViaBackwards](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/viabackwards.27448/) and [ViaRewind](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/viarewind.52109/) to allow 1.7.10 clients to connect.

## Can I make my paladium resourcepack work with this plugin ?

Yes, use [this](https://palavanilla-pack-converter.netlify.app/) !


## It doesn't work, what should I do ?

Ensure that you have the [NBT-API](https://modrinth.com/plugin/nbtapi/) plugin installed.
If you still have issues, please contact me on Discord: `crazycat256` and provide the error message if there is one.
